once the parts were printed, we started to assemble them, 1.75mm filament was used as a hinge. the hardware was added and we could do our first test.

You can see proof the mechanism works, as well as the servo encoder feedback loop.

### Bill of Materials (BOM)

| Item | Quantity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| 360Â° Continuous Rotation Servos | 4 | For driving the gear mechanisms |
| KY-040 Rotary Encoders | 4 | For position feedback |
| Raspberry Pi Pico | 1 | Main microcontroller |
| PCA9685 Servo Driver | 1 | For controlling multiple servos |
| PLA Filament | ~250g | For 3D printed components |
| Fishing Line | ~2m | Used as tendons for the mechanism |
| Dupont Connectors | ~20 | For electrical connections |


it was time to think about the covering
