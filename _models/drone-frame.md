## Drone Frame Component

This component was designed to provide a lightweight yet durable frame section for a quadcopter drone. The design incorporates:

- Honeycomb structure for weight reduction while maintaining strength
- Integrated cable routing channels
- Mounting points for standard motor sizes

### Design Process

I began with initial sketches focused on aerodynamic properties, then refined the design through stress testing in CAD software.

### Technical Specifications

- Material: Carbon-fiber reinforced PLA
- Weight: 28g
- Tensile strength: 68MPa
- Compatible with 2204-2306 size motors
