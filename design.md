# Design Development

we started by thinking of the articulated part of the project.
our first idea was a stacked 4 bar linkage, but this was not very effective

this was built using some 3d printed mechano like parts

while it worked, it wasn't the movnemt we were looking for, we tried an Ornithopter inspired mechanism

these test were more bird like than ray like, and they were more complex then we wanted

# Inspiration

while showing an old project for a finger to the team, we realised the mechanism could be reused for the manta ray!

here you can see the system for the tendons and knuckle assembly

the symetrical movment was much closer to the rays movment, infact ,much closer than it was to a hand! 

we started a fresh cad model with this design in mind

![cad sketch](/images/cad%20sketch%201.png)

here rigid section are connected by a flexible spring section, the stiffness of the spring can be adjusted by changing the wall thickness. teh printer nozzel is 0.4 so all complient parts were a multiple of this number. a variable was added to the cad program (onshape) to allow for parametric design. 

we kept the modular design of the finger, designing them to be attached to a frame by a sliding rail system.
