    <div class="stl-viewer-container">
      <script src="https://embed.github.com/view/3d/Ki-D-Talbot/Ki-D-Talbot.github.io/main/models/skin.stl">
      </script>
    </div>

For Realism we bought a plaice from the supermarket and took it to be 3d scanned!



A [HandySCAN Black Elite](https://www.creaform3d.com/en/products/portable-3d-scanners/portable-3d-scanner-handyscan-3d/technical-specifications) was used and it produced great texture of the skin. 

To get the texture on to the skin model we used
