## Aesthetics

the plan was to make a silicone 'glove' that the wing could slide into, one over each wing. the body would be printed and the whole thing would be painted.

A skin was designed in CAD

<!-- Add STL model viewer -->
<div class="col-12">
  <h3>3D Model Exploration</h3>
  <div class="stl-viewer-container">
    <script src="https://embed.github.com/view/3d/Ki-D-Talbot/Ki-D-Talbot.github.io/main/models/skin.stl">
    </script>
  </div>
  <p>Skin for one of the wings.</p>
</div>
<br>

The shape was made in cad although Blender would have been a better choice for more organic modelling like this.

For Realism we bought a plaice from the supermarket and took it to be 3d scanned!

A [HandySCAN Black Elite](https://www.creaform3d.com/en/products/portable-3d-scanners/portable-3d-scanner-handyscan-3d/technical-specifications) was used and it produced great texture of the skin.

To get the texture on to the skin model we tried to use a haptic pen by [3D Systems](https://www.3dsystems.com/haptics) and a Program called Mesh Mixer.
