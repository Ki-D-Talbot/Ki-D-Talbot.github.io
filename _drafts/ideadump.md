since the university of staffordshire has access to 3d printers, the artifact will been designed woth this in mind, this has heavily influenced the design desisions. 

after an initial research phase, it became clear that print in place and complient mechanisms were innovative method that were facilitated by teh manufacturing technics of 3d printing. [citation needed]

a manta ray was chosen as the subject of the scuplture. this biomemetic sculpture is designed to replicate the swimming motion of the ray.
