## Prototypes

Many prototypes were created, please endure this poorly edited montage

we ran into issues with calcuating the length of the tendons, joints are relivialy easy to animate in cad programs but cimpliant mechanisms are harder. we printed a a wing and marked a spot on the tendon, then bend the wing to the maximum posistion and and measuresed how far the tendon had moved. 

we also notices that the jointts further away from the base moved less then the ones closer to the base. we we reduces the wall width in the last joint to allow for more flex. 

This was all futile as the deign was vitoed by the team due to the girth of the wing. this was a shame as the totally print in place mechanism has so much potential. even with a brittle material like pla we were still able to get working proof of concepts, with a more pliable material like petg this would be even more robust.

from a manufacturing point of viewm having single part is a trade off between repaiability and ease of assembly. the whole thing would need to be replaces even if a tendon failed. this is easy to do but could be wasteful and environmentally damaging.
