# Prototypes

Many prototypes were created, please endure this poorly edited montage

We ran into issues with calculating the length of the tendons. Joints are relatively easy to animate in CAD programs but compliant mechanisms are harder to simulate accurately. This challenge is noted by Mutlu et al., who found that the complex deformation patterns of compliant mechanisms often require physical testing to validate computational models. We printed a wing and marked a spot on the tendon, then bent the wing to the maximum position and measured how far the tendon had moved.

We also noticed that the joints further away from the base moved less than the ones closer to the base. We reduced the wall width in the last joint to allow for more flex. This approach to variable flexibility aligns with Schumacher et al.'s research on controlling elasticity in 3D printed structures through strategic variation of geometric parameters.

This was all futile as the design was vetoed by the team due to the girth of the wing. This was a shame as the totally print-in-place mechanism has so much potential. Even with a brittle material like PLA we were still able to get working proof of concepts; with a more pliable material like PETG this would be even more robust. As noted by Liu and Hung (2022), material selection significantly impacts the performance and durability of 3D printed compliant mechanisms.

From a manufacturing point of view, having a single part is a trade-off between repairability and ease of assembly. The whole thing would need to be replaced even if a tendon failed. This is easy to do but could be wasteful and environmentally damaging. Culmone et al. (2020) highlight this trade-off in non-assembly 3D printing, noting that whilst single-piece designs eliminate assembly requirements, they can present challenges for maintenance and sustainability.
