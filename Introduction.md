## Introduction

The artefact is a desktop objét d'art, a sculpture designed to be displayed in an office environment or to showcase the capabilities of additive manufacturing. This setting will be out of direct sunlight and in a climate-controlled environment. It is not designed to be frequently handled or moved.

Since Staffordshire University has access to advanced 3D printing facilities, the artefact has been designed with these manufacturing capabilities in mind, which has heavily influenced the design decisions throughout the development process.

After an initial research phase, it became clear that print-in-place and compliant mechanisms represent innovative approaches that are uniquely facilitated by the manufacturing techniques of 3D printing (Howell et al., 2013). Compliant mechanisms—which achieve their motion through the elastic deformation of flexible members rather than traditional joints—offer significant advantages in biomimetic applications by reducing part count, eliminating assembly requirements, and creating more fluid, natural movements (Megaro et al., 2017).

A manta ray was chosen as the subject of the sculpture due to its elegant swimming motion and distinctive morphology. This biomimetic sculpture is designed to replicate the undulating, wave-like propulsion of the ray's pectoral fins. As Benyus (1997) argues in her seminal work on biomimicry, natural systems offer refined solutions that have evolved over millions of years, providing valuable inspiration for engineering design. The manta ray's efficient locomotion through fluid environments represents a particularly elegant example of nature's ingenuity (Fish et al., 2018).

The integration of compliant mechanisms with biomimetic design principles aligns well with what Vincent et al. (2006) describe as "transfer of function" from biological to engineering domains—in this case, translating the flexible cartilaginous structure of manta ray fins into a manufactured system capable of similar movement patterns.
