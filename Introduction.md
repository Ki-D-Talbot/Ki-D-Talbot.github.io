## Introduction

The artefact is a desktop objet d'art, a sculpture designed to be displayed in an office environment or to showcase the capabilities of additive manufacturing. This setting will be out of direct sunlight and in a clement environment. It is not designed to be frequently handled or moved about.

Since The university of Staffordfshire has access to 3D printers, the artefact has been designed with these manufacturing capabilities in mind, which has heavily influenced the design decisions throughout the development process.

After an initial research phase, it became clear that print-in-place and compliant mechanisms represent innovative approaches that are uniquely facilitated by the manufacturing techniques of 3D printing (Megaro et al., 2017). These mechanisms, which achieve motion through the elastic deformation of flexible members rather than traditional joints, offer significant advantages in biomimetic applications by reducing part count, eliminating assembly requirements, and creating more fluid, natural movements (Zolfagharian et al., 2021).

A manta ray was chosen as the subject of the sculpture due to its elegant swimming motion and distinctive morphology. This biomimetic sculpture is designed to replicate the undulating, wave-like propulsion of the ray's pectoral fins. As noted by Culmone et al. (2020), biomimetic approaches that leverage non-assembly 3D printing techniques can create sophisticated movement systems that mimic natural forms whilst maintaining a simplified manufacturing process, making them ideal for sculptural applications that demonstrate mechanical principles.
