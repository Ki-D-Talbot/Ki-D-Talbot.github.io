                <h1>Robotic Modelling and Drone Skin Project</h1>
                <p>A biomimetic sculpture of a manta ray, designed to 'swim' with minimal hardware and 3D-printed compliant mechanisms.</p>
            </header>
            
            <section>
                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>This project focuses on the intersection of biomimicry and compliant mechanisms. 
                    Our design aims to replicate the fluid motion of a manta ray's wings using as few mechanical components as possible. 
                    The sculpture will be 3D-printed with minimal post-print assembly, emphasizing print orientation to optimize for compliance and smooth movement.</p>

                <h3>Design Goals</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use of biomimicry to aproximate movement similar to manta rays.</li>
                    <li>Utilization of compliant mechanisms to reduce the number of mechanical parts.</li>
                    <li>Minimal hardware and assembly required.</li>
                    <li>Focus on 3D printing with moving parts printed in place.</li>
                    <li>Careful consideration of print orientation to align layer lines for optimal flexibility and durability.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Manufacturing Considerations</h3>
                <p>The sculpture is designed for ease of manufacturing using a standard 3D printer. Key considerations include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Print orientation and layer adhesion to ensure structural integrity and desired flexibility.</li>
                    <li>Material selection to balance rigidity and compliance for the wing movement.</li>
                    <li>Reducing post-processing and assembly time by printing moving parts in place.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Maintenance and Repair</h3>
                <p>Given the sculpture's reliance on compliant mechanisms and printed-in-place components, 
                    maintenance is expected to be minimal. In the event of failure, 
                    the entire sculpture can be reprinted, or specific components could be replaced with new prints. 
                    Through thorough testing, material choice and designing the complient components to minimise stress points
                     the artifact should be very robust</p>

                <p>After printing a few prototypes it became apparent that it was wasteful to print the mechanism as a whole,
                    splitting the model up would allow for not only quick printing of replacement parts but also would allow for rapid prototyping,
                    where the stiffness and flexibility of the complient components coudl be finetuned. </p>

                <h3>CAD Design</h3>
                <p>The design will be created in CAD software, focusing on the precise articulation of the manta ray's wings. 
                    Below are some design considerations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wing flexibility modeled after the natural movement of a manta ray.</li>
                    <li>Internal compliant mechanisms to reduce the need for external motors or servos.</li>
                    <li>Printing orientation carefully chosen to align with movement direction for maximum flexibility and durability.</li>
                </ul>

            <section>
                <h3>3D Printing</h3>
                <p>
                    3D printing could be accurately described as "2.5D printing" because it involves printing multiple thin, 
                    essentially 2D layers on top of each other. Each layer’s adhesion is often the weakest point in a 
                    3D-printed object, so choosing the correct print orientation is critical to achieving structural 
                    integrity.

                    To turn a CAD model into a 3D print, we use slicing software. This software takes
                    a model, either created in CAD programs or downloaded from online repositories
                    like Thingiverse or Printables, and converts it into G-code—printer instructions
                    that guide the printing process. Adjusting the model’s orientation within the
                    slicer helps determine the final layer line direction, which is key to managing
                    the part's strength along specific axes.

                    Overhangs are a particular challenge in 3D printing, as unsupported areas require
                    additional material, known as supports, to prevent sagging or warping during the 
                    build. Strategically positioning the model in the slicer helps to minimize support 
                    material, but there is often a compromise between using fewer supports and 
                    maximizing strength. Balancing these considerations is essential for efficient, 
                    robust prints.
