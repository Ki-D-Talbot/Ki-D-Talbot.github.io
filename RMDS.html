                <ul>
                    <li>Use as little additional hardware as possible</li>
                    <li>Require minimal post-processing</li>
                    <li>Avoid using exotic materials</li>
                    <li>Explore compliance wherever possible</li>

                <h2>3D Printing Considerations</h2>
                <p>3D printing is more accurately described as "2.5D printing" because it involves printing multiple thin, essentially 2D layers on top of each other. Each layer’s adhesion is often the weakest point in a 3D-printed object, so choosing the correct print orientation is critical to achieving structural integrity.</p>

                <p>To turn a CAD model into a 3D print, we use slicing software. This software takes a model, either created in CAD programs or downloaded from online repositories like Thingiverse or Printables, and converts it into G-code—printer instructions that guide the printing process. Adjusting the model’s orientation within the slicer helps determine the final layer line direction, which is key to managing the part's strength along specific axes.</p>

                <p>Overhangs are a particular challenge in 3D printing, as unsupported areas require additional material, known as supports, to prevent sagging or warping during the build. Strategically positioning the model in the slicer helps to minimize support material, but there is often a compromise between using fewer supports and maximizing strength. Balancing these considerations is essential for efficient, robust prints.</p>
